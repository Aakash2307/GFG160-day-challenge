# Approach to Reverse an Array

### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `arr[]`. Your task is to reverse the given array.

---

### Approach

To reverse the array, the most efficient way is to swap the elements from both ends of the array towards the center. 

We can perform this reversal **in-place** without requiring extra space for another array.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - We use two pointers, `i` and `j`. The pointer `i` starts from the beginning (index `0`), and `j` starts from the end (index `n-1`), where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Swapping Elements**:
   - While `i < j`:
     - Swap the elements at positions `i` and `j`.
     - Increment `i` and decrement `j` to move towards the center.
   
3. **Repeat**:
   - Continue swapping until `i` is no longer less than `j` (i.e., the pointers cross or meet in the middle).

4. **Result**:
   - The array is reversed in place, and no extra space is required for this operation.

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input**:  
`arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]`

**Execution**:
1. **Initial state**:  
   `arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]`, `i = 0`, `j = 5`.
   
2. **First Swap** (`i = 0`, `j = 5`):  
   Swap `arr[0]` and `arr[5]`:  
   `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 6, 1]`, `i = 1`, `j = 4`.
   
3. **Second Swap** (`i = 1`, `j = 4`):  
   Swap `arr[1]` and `arr[4]`:  
   `arr = [5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1]`, `i = 2`, `j = 3`.
   
4. **Third Swap** (`i = 2`, `j = 3`):  
   Swap `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`:  
   `arr = [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, `i = 3`, `j = 2`.

   Now, `i` is no longer less than `j`, so the loop stops.

**Final Output**:  
`[5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]`

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**:  
  `O(n)` — We only loop through the array once, performing a constant-time swap at each step.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  `O(1)` — We perform the reversal in-place with no extra space needed other than a few variables for indexing.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseArray(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        
        # Swap elements from both ends of the array
        for i in range(n // 2):
            arr[i], arr[n - i - 1] = arr[n - i - 1], arr[i]
        
        return arr
